            <h3>The Bedford<br>Canal Experiments</h3>
            <p class="nubers">
                The classic Flat Earth water convexity experiments were described in the book Earth Not a Globe by Samuel Birley Rowbotham. Rowbotham lives near the canal and performs the experiment numerous times over a long period of time. The Bedford Canal is a man-made canal which was selected as the most ideal location for the types of experiments performed due to the narrow passageways and low disturbance of the water's surface.

Of special interest, and in regards to the popularized subject of refraction, we look at the second experiment in the text.

                <h3>Sinking Ship<br>Effect</h3>
                <p class="nubers">
                    The Sinking Ship Effect is often used as evidence of the earth's rotundity. It was one of the first proofs of Aristotle and other philosophers. It was based primarily upon this phenomenon that the earth was declared by the ancients to be globular. It has been found that when the phenomenon is studied with modern methods, such as through long period time-lapse photography, that the Sinking Ship Effect is not consistent. The effect appears to come and go over time.

                <h3>The Bishop<br>Experiment</h3>
                <p class="nubers">
                    IF the earth is a globe, and is 24,900 English statute miles in circumference, the surface of all standing water must have a certain degree of convexity--every part must be an arc of a circle. From the summit of any such arc there will exist a curvature or declination of 8 inches over the first statute mile. Over two miles the fall will be 32 inches; by the end of the third mile, 72 inches, or 6 feet, as shown in this chart.

Correcting for the height of the observer of about 20 inches, when looking at the opposite beach over 23 miles away there should be a bulge of water obscuring objects up to 300 feet above the far beach. There isn't. Even accounting for refraction, the amount hidden should be around 260 feet - seeing down to the shoreline should be impossible.
